        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Angelina Samaan and I am 19 years old. I graduated from La Sierra Academy high school in 2021, and I am now currently a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying psychology in hopes of becoming a psychologist in the future. Mental health has always intrigued me. I have luckily had the ability to be very intuitive and understand peopleâ€™s behavior, and why they do the things they do. Since this comes easy to me, and because I always want to help others, these were a few of the reasons that fueled my interest and love for psychology. I have constantly researched psychology theories and have always been interested in it. I am very passionate about psychology because I am genuinely interested in the topic. I am middle eastern and mental health is never really talked about and most-often dismissed. It is extremely important for me to become a psychologist despite the cultural disapproval. My hope is to not only help my clients, but to educate others on the importance of mental health in the process as well. Due to all these reasons, I am very enthusiastic and excited to work in the mental health department.<br><br>

        I volunteer at Corona Family Dental Center in my free time. It is my Parents dental practice and I have chosen to help them out and volunteer there since I was young. Since I grew up in a place of business and watching how a business is run I am very educated in it. It has made me resilient, driven, and hardworking. It has made me realize that I am a leader and I love to work. I like to give my all to my work, I canâ€™t just give my minimum effort. I will always work hard even if that means doing a project for hours to perfect it because I will not stop until I am finished. My mom showed me the ropes of what it takes to be a business woman. Seeing her run multiple offices has inspired me to follow in her footsteps and be just as hardworking as she is. She has taught me many fundamental lessons on being a leader. <br><br>

        I look forward to taking everything I have learned from my past work experience and schooling to become something great. In high school I had many different leadership positions like, class office, captain of the volleyball team, national society, etc. I have always loved being a leader and working and I adapt that to my everyday life and look forward to adapting that in my future job.  I still have many years of schooling before I can do the job I desire, but I am looking forward to it. I am very grateful to have the experiences Iâ€™ve had and to have had a mentor that taught me exactly what it takes to be successful and a good employee/boss. I am excited for my future job that I will love doing.
